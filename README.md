# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository implements a machine learning model to predict cryptocurrency prices, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The goal of this project is to build a system that can forecast the future price of a cryptocurrency based on historical data and market indicators.

## About

Cryptocurrency market analysis is a crucial area for investors and traders. This project aims to predict the price movement of popular cryptocurrencies using machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, and deep learning models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). The system uses historical price data and additional market features to make predictions about future prices.

### Features
- Collect and preprocess historical cryptocurrency data.
- Train machine learning models for time series forecasting.
- Evaluate the models based on prediction accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE).
- Make real-time cryptocurrency price predictions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6+
- `pip` or `conda` for package management

The following Python libraries are required:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `keras` (for deep learning models)
- `tensorflow`
- `yfinance` (for fetching historical data)
- `plotly` (for advanced visualizations)

You can install the necessary libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cryptocurrency-price-prediction.git
cd cryptocurrency-price-prediction
```

2. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Fetch Cryptocurrency Data
To collect historical data for cryptocurrencies, use the following script. It fetches data from Yahoo Finance or other APIs (like CoinGecko) and saves it into a CSV file:

```bash
python fetch_data.py --symbol BTC-USD --start '2015-01-01' --end '2024-01-01'
```

You can replace `BTC-USD` with other cryptocurrency symbols (like `ETH-USD` for Ethereum).

### 2. Preprocess Data
Once the data is fetched, preprocess it by normalizing, handling missing values, and preparing it for model training. Run:

```bash
python preprocess_data.py
```

This will clean and structure the data into features that can be used for training machine learning models.

### 3. Train the Model
Train the machine learning models to predict cryptocurrency prices. The available models include:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** for time-series prediction

Run the following command to train a model:

```bash
python train_model.py --model LSTM
```

This will train the specified model using the historical data and save the trained model to a file for future use.

### 4. Make Predictions
After training the model, you can use it to make price predictions. For example, to predict the price of Bitcoin for the next 7 days:

```bash
python predict.py --model LSTM --days 7
```

This will output the predicted future prices.

## Model Architecture

The project includes several machine learning models for cryptocurrency price prediction:

### 1. Linear Regression
A simple model for predicting the next day’s price based on historical data. It assumes a linear relationship between past prices and future values.

### 2. Random Forest
An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to predict the price by considering various features like historical prices, market sentiment, and trading volume.

### 3. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
A classification-based approach for predicting the trend (up or down) of the cryptocurrency price.

### 4. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
An advanced deep learning model used for time series forecasting. LSTMs are well-suited for capturing the temporal dependencies of cryptocurrency prices over time.

The models use features like historical prices, moving averages, and technical indicators (such as RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands) to improve prediction accuracy.

## Data

This project uses historical price data of cryptocurrencies, which is fetched using the `yfinance` library from Yahoo Finance or APIs like CoinGecko.

### Dataset Structure:
```
data/
  |- btc_data.csv
  |- eth_data.csv
```

Each CSV file contains data with columns like:

- Date
- Open Price
- Close Price
- High Price
- Low Price
- Volume

You can download more data or fetch real-time market data from APIs for live predictions.

## Results

After training and evaluating the models, we use the following metrics to assess performance:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Measures the square root of the average of squared differences between prediction and actual values.
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions for up or down trends.

To evaluate the performance of your trained model, run:

```bash
python evaluate_model.py --model LSTM
```

This will show evaluation metrics and a comparison between actual and predicted prices.
